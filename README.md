\# Big Numbers Calculator

Written in C for academic purposes, the code is messy, but making it clean wasn't the objective of this project. This work taught me about using strings without a string library and how dynamically allocated memory works in C.

In /Doc directory there is help.txt file written in polish, read it if want to use calculator.
In /Exe: kalk.exe - executable of main
In /Input we have example for input to test it
In /Source: main.c - containing all source code written in C
